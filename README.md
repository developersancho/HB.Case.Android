<h1 align="center"> HB Case Android and Compose Version </h1>

Android Clean Architecture in HB Case Sample is a sample project that presents modern, approach to [Android](https://www.android.com/) application development using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and latest tech-stack.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android
application architecture that is modular, scalable, maintainable and testable. This application may look simple, but it
has all of these small details that will set the rock-solid foundation of the larger app suitable for bigger teams and
long application lifecycle management.

An android app built using Kotlin that consumes [iTunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH3-SW1) allows you to place search fields in your website to search for content within the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store and Mac App Store.
It has been built following Clean Architecture Principle, Repository Pattern, MVVM Architecture in the presentation layer as well as Jetpack components.

## Environment Setup

You require the minimum Android Studio ```Chipmunk``` to be able to build the app.

## Architecture
A well planned architecture is extremely important for an app to scale and all architectures have one common goal- to manage complexity of your app. This isn't something to be worried about in smaller apps however it may prove very useful when working on apps with longer development lifecycle and a bigger team.

Clean architecture was proposed by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) in 2012 in the [Clean Code Blog](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and it follow the SOLID principle.

<p align="center"><img src="art/clean_arch.jpeg" alt="Clean Architecture"></p>

The circles represent different layers of your app. Note that:

- The center circle is the most abstract, and the outer circle is the most concrete. This is called the [Abstraction Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_principle_(computer_programming)). The Abstraction Principle specifies that inner circles should contain business logic, and outer circles should contain implementation details.

- Another principle of Clean Architecture is the [Dependency Inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). This rule specifies that each circle can depend only on the nearest inward circle ie. low-level modules do not depend on high-level modules but the other way around.

<p align="center"><img src="art/architecture.png" alt="Clean Architecture Diagram"></p>

### Why Clean Architecture?
- ```Loose coupling between the code``` - The code can easily be modified without affecting any or a large part of the app's codebase thus easier to scale the application later on.
- Easier to ```test``` code.
- ```Separation of Concern``` - Different modules have specific responsibilities making it easier for modification and maintenance.

### S.O.L.I.D Principles

- [__Single Responsibility__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle): Each software component should have only one reason to change – one responsibility.

- [__Open-Closed__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20programming%2C%20the,without%20modifying%20its%20source%20code.): You should be able to extend the behavior of a component, without breaking its usage, or modifying its extensions.

- [__Liskov Substitution__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle): If you have a class of one type, and any subclasses of that class, you should be able to represent the base class usage with the subclass, without breaking the app.

- [__Interface Segregation__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle): It’s better to have many smaller interfaces than a large one, to prevent the class from implementing the methods that it doesn’t need.

- [__Dependency Inversion__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle): Components should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Also higher level modules shouldn’t depend on lower level modules.

## Layers

### Project Structure
<p align="center"><img src="art/project.png" alt="Project Structure" width="500"></p>

### BuildSrc
The ```buildSrc``` layer is responsible for dependency management. It control and manage all dependencies in one place with Kotlin.

### App
The ```app``` layer is responsible for common, general properties and features about presentation.

- __features__: Contains components involved in showing information to the user. The main part of this layer are the views(activity, compose) and ViewModels.

- __widgets__: This is responsible for common view components that using app.


### App-Compose
The ```appcompose``` layer is responsible for common, general properties and features about presentation with compose version.

- __features__: Contains components involved in showing information to the user. The main part of this layer are the views(activity, compose) and ViewModels.

- __widgets__: This is responsible for common view components that using app.

- __theme__: Defines themes, colors, fonts and resource files.


### Libraries
The ```libraries``` layer is responsible for base structure.

- __framework__: Contains different utilities that can be used by the different modules and base structures.

- __navigation__: Contains utilities navigate before fragments.

- __testutils__: Contains the definitions of the test utilities.

### Data
The ```data``` layer is responsible for selecting the proper data source for the domain layer. It contains the implementations of the repositories declared in the domain layer.

Components of data layer include:
- __model__

  -__dto__: Defines dto of ui model, also perform data transformation between ```domain```, ```response``` and ```entity``` models.

  -__local__: Defines the schema of SQLite database.

  -__remote__: Defines POJO of network responses.

- __local__: This is responsible for performing caching operations using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room).

- __remote__: This is responsible for performing network operations eg. defining API endpoints using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).

- __repository__: Responsible for exposing data to the domain layer.

### Domain
This is the core layer of the application. The ```domain``` layer is independent of any other layers thus ] domain business logic can be independent from other layers.This means that changes in other layers will have no effect on domain layer eg.  screen UI (presentation layer) or changing database (data layer) will not result in any code change withing domain layer.

Components of domain layer include:
- __usecase__: They enclose a single action, like getting data from a database or posting to a service. They use the repositories to resolve the action they are supposed to do. They usually override the operator ```invoke``` , so they can be called as a function.
